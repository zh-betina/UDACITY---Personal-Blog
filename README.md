# UDACITY---Personal-Blog
(Learning projects.)

	(Errata: In some of my commits you can read UDEMY. Actually I confused the two.
	Instead of typing UDACITY, I had typed UDEMY. Obviously, the whole repository
	is linked to my UDACITY training.)

A repository hosting files serving the 1st project from Udemy Front-End Development Nanodegree.

1st project: Personal blog.
Project realized with HTML5 and CSS3.
